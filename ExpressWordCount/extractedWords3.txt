,,recommending,particular,tools ,and,what,each,part,of,the,environment,is,for.,Tools,A,Node,development,Environment,is,comprised,of,multiple,different,technologies,,that,are,linked,together,to,promote,a,simple,workflow ,saving,time,and,creating,a,,safer,development,environment,for,the,team.,A,typical,environment,will,be,comprised,of,the,following.,1.,Build,Tool,2.,Transpiler,3.,Linter,4.,Testing,%E2%80%BA,Mocking,%E2%80%BA,Helper,Libraries,5.,Automation,Toolkit,The,environment,creates,its,own,pseudo-pipeline,that,would,look,like,this.,,QA,Consulting,,-,Course,Handout,2,Node,Development,Environment,BUILD,TOOL,Also,known,as,bundlers ,build,tools,will,generally,move%2Fcompile%2Fcreate,files,com,-,prised,of,the,files,you,have,created.,For,example ,in,your,project,you,might,create,20,separate,javascript,files ,utilising,,other,libraries,within,those,files ,you,won't,want,your,users,to,have,to,download,,all,20 ,so,you,could,use,a,build,tool%2Fbundler,to,package,these,all,together,into,one,,file ,but,then,it,will,change,your,html,references,to,those,script,files,it,created ,not,,altering,how,your,project,works.,Build,tools,can,do,a,lot,more,than,this,though.,,Through,the,use,of,plugins,you,can,enable,other,features,that,it,can,do,to,your,,project ,creating,a,pseudo-pipeline,that,your,code,will,go,through,until,it,hits,a,,stage,you,can,view,it,or,deploy,it,for,production.,Some,example,features,that,you'll,be,exposed,to,are%3B,%E2%80%A2,Minifying,,%E2%80%BA,The,process,of,reducing,the,filesize,of,your,code,%E2%80%A2,Uglifying,(Obfuscating),%E2%80%BA,Making,your,code,unreadable

,gener,-,ally,this,is,from,one,language,to,another.,For,example,there's,a,JavaScript,superset,,called,Elm,which,is,a,functional,version,of,javascript ,however,the,syntax,is,vastly,,different,so,it,would,not,run,on,a,browser ,so,once,you've,finished,developing,you,,would,transpile,this,Elm,code,into,normal,JavaScript,code,so,it,would,run.,Numerous,other,languages,like,to,transpile,to,JavaScript ,since,they,like,the,ability,,of,deploying,where,javascript,can,deploy,(Anywhere!),But,prefer,coding,in,another,,language,(Such,as,GoLang),The,transpilers,that,we,are,interested,are,a,lot,simpler,than,this ,there,is,a,tran,-,spiler,called,,babel,,that,lets,us,code,to,the,latest,version,of,JavaScript,that,is,in,,draft ,aka,all,the,latest,features,of,the,language ,however,they're,not,all,available,,on,every,environment ,so,babel,will,transpile,it,to,a,version,that,is,available,to,run.,,This,lets,us,use,all,the,features,of,the,latest,version,with,none,of,the,downsides,of,,incompatibility!,babel,,-,,https:%2F%2Fbabeljs.io%2F,LINTER,Linting,simply,put,is,code,analysis,that,will,tell,you,problems,will,your,code ,,whether,that,be,invalid,syntax,or,formatting,errors%2Fpreferences,that,your,team,has,,imposed,upon,you.,Linters,generally,come,with,a,default,set,of,rules,to,follow,but,your,team,will,cre,-,ate,a,custom,set,that,they,want,to,adhere,too.,ESLint,,is,the,most,popular,linter,currently,and,offers,a,broad,range,of,customiza,-,bility,and,configurability.,Linters,are,also,part,of,the,CI,Pipeline ,where,if,a,linter,detects,an,%E2%80%9Cerror%E2%80%9D,or,a,cer,-,tain,number,of,warnings

,Jasmine,comes,with,,an,assertion,library,built,in ,a,popular,assertion,library,alongside,Mocha,is,,Chai,.,In,the,end,most,frameworks%2Fassertion,libraries,accomplish,the,same,thing

,they,,help,you,create,simpler%2Fquicker,tests,that,may,enable,you,to,test,things,you,other,-,wise,could,not.,An,example,helper,library,is,,JSDom, ,you,will,be,running,your,tests,in,,node,,so,,there,isn't,inherently,a,document,to,open,and,check,elements,on,the,page,through,,the,,document,,object.,JSDom,re-creates,this,,virtual,dom,,and,then,you,can,interact,,with,the,page,like,you,would,normally.,Another,example,library,is,,Cheerio, ,which,is,effectively,,jquery,,for,node ,great,if,,you're,familiar,with,jquery,and,want,it,to,create,tests.,JSDom,,-,,https:%2F%2Fwww.npmjs.com%2Fpackage%2Fnode-jsdom,QA,Consulting,,-,Course,Handout,5,Node,Development,Environment,Mocking,Tools,,are,libraries,that,will,generate,fake,data,or,let,you,hot-swap,envi,-,ronments.,For,example ,if,you,have,an,online,database,you,generally,fetch,data,from,and,,then,work,with ,if,you,wanted,to,work,offline,you,wouldn't,be,able,to,test,your,,code ,so,you,could,,mock,,a,database,with,some,raw%2Ffake,data,and,then,your,code,,should,then,work,with,that,data.,An,example,mocking,setup,would,be,to,use,,JSON,Schema,Faker,,to,generate,the,,fake,data,and,,JSON,Server,,to,provide,that,data.,JSON,Schema,Faker,,-,,https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjson-schema-faker%2Fjson-schema-faker,JSON,Server,,-,,https:%2F%2Fwww.npmjs.com%2Fpackage%2Fjson-server,AUTOMATION,TOOLKIT,All,of,the,things,listed,are,the,,bare,minimum,,and,it's,already,a,lot,of,tools

,so,we,need,,another,,tool,to,bring,all,these,together,to,do,it,for,us ,so,,every,time,we,save,this,will,all,happen.,Popular,automation,toolkits,are%3B,,%E2%80%A2,Grunt,(Old),%E2%80%A2,Gulp,(Replaced,Grunt),%E2%80%A2,NPM,Scripts,(Replaced,Gulp),Whilst,Gulp,has,a,lot,of,plugins,that,might,make,you,want,to,choose,it
